The application contains user mode and admin mode, with their respective functionalities.
There are separate text files for admin (admin.txt), cars (car.txt), and user (customer.txt).
The files contain data for a few entries.
The program is flexible to accomodate any number of users, cars, or admins entries in the files.
While making a new entry in any file, make sure to follow the format of above entries in the file, otherwise the program might misbehave.
